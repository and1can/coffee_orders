    "# Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized algorithm, view_three.py looks at three orders at a time. The algorithm will then sort these three orders into increasing time to brew the drinks. The fastest drink to brew will be given to the barista first available, then the medium drink, and then lastly the fastest drink. The algorithm repeats this process until there are no more orders or there is not a number of orders that is divisible by 3. In the case that there is not a number of orders that is divisible by 3 or there are not at least 3 orders remaining to be processed, the algorithm will process the remaining orders greedily by giving the first available barista the first order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My justification for looking at three orders as a time is that it is possible to have a cafe where orders are made on an app and large queues will be built quickly. We at the cafe, may have delay to wait for three orders, but the delay will be large because people are placing orders via an app. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm causes the baristas to process the fastest drinks of the 3 ordered queue and is designed like this to decrease the average wait times of tea and latte. The order that takes the longest brewing time of the three will be processed last even if the order is made before the first two. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that this tradeoff to allow the drinks with faster brew time and less profit to have shorter wait times is justified because customers can justify a drink that is expensive to take a long time. On the contrary, a customer cannot justify that tea takes longer to brew than affogato while tea is cheaper than affogato. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other reason why processing drinks with shorter brew times first is better is that it allows the baristas to be available as soon as possible to process subsequent orders. \n",
    "\n",
    "The drinks that have shorter brew times also have less profit. However, the profit of processing more expensive drinks will be overtaken because the time saved processing shorter brew times first will result in more time to process more drinks and ultimately lead to more profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other reason why time is a little bit more important than profit is that percentage of orders for each type of drink is really important. In this day and age, Yelp and rivals post the customer experience. If there is less time to process orders, the cafe will have lots of drinks not processed. This will result in customers posting things online that says our company fails to complete most of tea orders for example. "

    "## 1. Uniform Distribution of Order Times and Uniform Distribution of Types of Drinks Ordered\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the view_three algorithm saves time and is able to process just as many drinks as fifo. Now, I do understand that tying does not seem better. However, I would like to point out that fifo algorithm has a caveat that allows fifo to process orders that are completed after t=100, but the optimized algorithm does not have this luxury. Despite this caveat, tying is impressive because it means that in the worst case, fifo.py can process two more drinks than view_three.py. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the profit is at a difference of 6, I would say 6 is not too signficiant because if the fifo.py caveat is lifted from view_three.py, the best case allows view_three.py to process 2 drinks and the two drinks with the least profit would yield 6. Now, if view_three were able to process two more drinks by lifting the fifo caveat, view_three would have a better percentage of drinks completed, which shows that this algorithm saves time and can complete more orders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Glancing at the average wait times of each individual drink, we see that fifo is slower than view_three at completing tea by about t=4 (let us just assume it is seconds as a placeholder for now), latte by t=1. However, fifo processes affogato faster than view_three by t=4. This is a consequence that the algorithm trades for the shorter wait time of teas and lattes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this first ditribution optimizes the metrics I set out to optimize and yields the results that I anticipated. The view_three algorithm does better than the fifo algorithm except in profit, but not by a large enough margin to deem this view_three algorithm as inferior to the fifo algorithm. "

In experiment 2 view_three performed better on all metrics, but not too much better for average wait times for tea and latte. In experiment 3, fifo performs better in more metrics than view_three algorithm. In experiment 4, view_three algorithm does better on 3 of the 4 metrics.  \n",

    "It seems that view_three may be better than fifo algorithm because on 3 of the 4 experiments, view_three performs better on more metrics than fifo. However, to be completely confident in this optimized algorithm: view_three, I would run more experiments with the same distribution to make sure that the results are not the way they are by chance.
